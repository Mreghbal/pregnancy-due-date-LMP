# pregnancy-due-date-LMP
A Python code for calculating the pregnancy due date based on the last menstrual period (LMP). Here's an example code that includes all the necessary parameters
In this code, we define a function called calculate_due_date() that takes the LMP as input and calculates the due date by adding 280 days to the LMP. We then prompt the user to enter the LMP in the format "YYYY-MM-DD" and convert it to a datetime object using strptime(). Finally, we call the calculate_due_date() function with the LMP and print the resulting due date.

Note: This code assumes a gestation period of 280 days, which is the average length of a pregnancy. However, please keep in mind that individual pregnancies can vary, and it's always best to consult with a healthcare professional for accurate due date calculations.
